## Introduction
  - This solo project allowed us to explore creating a webpage nearly from scratch, including writing the HTML framework, adding style properties with CSS, and functionality with Javascript. The webpage allows users to enter their name and receive either an affirmation or mantra. It also allows the user to clear the message.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- Each radio button will display either a mantra or affirmation when the button, "Receive Message" is clicked.
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose is a "Clear Message" button that clears the message and returns the meditation icon.
- I also included a login page which allows the user to enter their name and receive a personalized greeting after clicking, "Submit".


## Possible Future Extensions
  - Ability to personalize and create your own mantra/affirmation.
  -Ability to change the style theme.
